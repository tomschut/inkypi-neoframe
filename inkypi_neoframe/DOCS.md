# Install on Home Assistant OS

This add-on currently supports **amd64 (x86-64)** HAOS. Supervisor builds InkyPi locally on your HAOS machine, so the first installation needs internet access and can take several minutes.

## Add the repository

1. In Home Assistant, open **Settings → Add-ons → Add-on store** (called **Settings → Apps → App store** on newer versions).
2. Open the **⋮** menu (top right) → **Repositories**.
3. Add `https://github.com/tomschut/inkypi-neoframe` and click **Add**, then close the dialog. The store reloads; if the new add-on doesn't appear, reload the page.
4. Find **InkyPi NeoFrame** in the store, choose **Install**, then **Start**. Enable **Start on boot** and, optionally, **Watchdog**.
5. Select **Open Web UI**, or visit `http://<HAOS-IP>:8084/`. Create your image content and playlists in InkyPi.
6. Set the Project 1 firmware's `image_url` to `http://<HAOS-IP>:8084/api/current_frame`.

The firmware must support the packed Spectra-6 format. The first successful render makes a 960000-byte frame available. `/api/current_image` remains a PNG. If port 8084 is already used on HAOS, change the host port in the add-on's Network settings and use that port in the firmware URL.

## Manual install (no GitHub access)

If HAOS can't reach GitHub, install from a local folder instead: run `python3 scripts/package_addon.py` in this repo to produce `dist/inkypi-neoframe-haos.tar.gz`, extract it, and copy the `inkypi_neoframe` folder over Samba into the `addons` share so the resulting path is `/addons/inkypi_neoframe/config.yaml`. It then appears under **Local add-ons** in the store; install it the same way as above.

## Storage and updates

Device settings, playlists, uploaded images, the current PNG/BIN and API keys live in Supervisor's persistent `/data` volume. They survive container replacement and are included in add-on backups. Configuration is managed in the InkyPi UI; there are no extra YAML options. Back up the add-on before uninstalling it.

Repository installs update like any other add-on: **Check for updates** in the store, then **Update** on the add-on's page. For a manual/local install, replace the add-on folder and use **Rebuild** from its menu instead. Either way `/data` is preserved — the startup script seeds defaults only when a persistent file or image directory does not yet exist.

The web UI and firmware endpoint are directly available on the configured LAN port and have no Home Assistant login protection. Keep the port on your trusted LAN. Ingress is not enabled because upstream uses root-relative URLs.

## Scope and verification

The add-on needs no hardware devices, privileged mode, host networking, Docker socket or Supervisor API access. It uses the default protection settings. It renders remotely for the ESP32; no display attaches to the HAOS host.

The amd64 container is tested locally with Podman, including persistent data after replacement. Actual installation under Supervisor and the physical panel remain environment-specific checks. ARM64 is not advertised or tested in this release.
